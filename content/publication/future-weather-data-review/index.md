abstract: "Buildings use a large amount of energy, depending on the climate. To design buildings with high energy and thermal performance in the future, it is necessary to use weather data that reflect future climatic information. Some future weather files for building simulations have been developed. However, these datasets are based on different predictions, and each future weather file has a different creation process. Such methodological differences may lead to differences in predicting the energy and thermal performance of buildings. Understanding the characteristics of each data type is necessary for its appropriate use. However, limited information is available for properly utilizing future weather data for building simulations. This study aims to provide information on the characteristics of future weather data for better utilization. After thoroughly reviewing the existing data and creation methods, we propose a framework for understanding future weather data based on their creative process. We collected five types of future weather datasets available in Japan and compared their characteristics. One of these datasets is the future weather dataset based on climate information provided by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES). We confirmed the degree of variation in each weather element and predicted cooling/heating demand using future weather data available in Japan."
